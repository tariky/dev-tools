## What is CapRover?

You are probably familiar with cPanel, a web hosting control panel that allows you to manage your websites, databases, and other services. CapRover is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to cPanel. It is a web-based app deployment &amp; management platform for your Docker-compose apps. It is a free and open-source project that you can install on your own server. It is a great tool for developers and system administrators who want to deploy their apps quickly and easily.

## What are requirements?

To see all requirements visit CapRover documentation website

[CapRover Documentation](https://caprover.com/docs/get-started.html)

## Info you will not find in documentation

If you want to install CapRover to ARM64 server you are out of luck. Currently automatic installation does not work. You will need to compile code for yourself.

## Installation

To install CapRover run this command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3000:3000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /captain:/captain caprover/caprover
```

After installation is finished wait for about 30sec to 1 min for everything to start.

Then visit `caprover.[SERVER_IP]`

Default password is `captain42`
